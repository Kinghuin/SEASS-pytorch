### Noticement
1. When running train.py, the console may print out EOFError or ConnectionResetError, which is caused by DataLoader module of pytorch. I don't know why but it does not influence the training process. Neglect It!
2. This project haven't finish yet, there are bugs to be fix, and modules to be implement.

### TODO LIST
1. Implement maxout layer
2. ROUGE metric
2. Change Bahdanaum attention to Luong attention
3. Fix bugs on decoder
